Instead of using an interface in a traditional way we use an instance variable that is a subclass
of the Flies interface. Animal doesn't care what flyingType does, it just knows the behavior is available to its subclasses
This is known as Composition : Instead of inheriting an ability through inheritance the class is composed
with Objects with the right ability. Composition allows you to change the capabilities of
objects at run time!
